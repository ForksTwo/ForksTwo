If you came from one of my skins called "name of skin is in github" the full name of the skin is "doing that old weezer blue thing in ponytown is the equivalent to wearing t-shirts of bands you don't know of"

Inspo from my skins is okay. sometimes i genuinely get inspired by other skins too but when I actually make something all by myself just don't create a literal copy of my skins ;)

also if you see me running around the map so many times it's because that I'm desperate to find people with my interests 

If you know me from way way back i don't do things that much like how i used to do because he isn't here anymore.
