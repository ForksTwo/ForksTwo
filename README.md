## Welcome to my GitHub!!

Hey hey!! I'm Erynn/June (real names, use with caution) but you can always call me what my name displays!

Unlike other most Pony Town players who use github for their accounts, I actually want to plan a very awesome game but I suck at coding and I'm only good with Scratch and all that

### Where to find me in Pony Town!!!! :D
  You can find me on the following marked plots on the Pony Town safe server map:

#### Regretevator area
I mostly sit outside of the bakery with my friend @MrHappyNSad, and in most cases you can see me in or somewhere surrounding the bush in this area. 

If he's offline then I just stay in the bush and vice versa

We're there because we're trying to give out a 'be careful what you say' look and be the most feared players

#### OSC area
I dunno where these are assumptions are coming from, I AM ACTUALLY NOT THAT FORKSTOE PERSON from the osc area stop asking :(

But the reason why I marked it on the map and put a section here is because people think I do and I'm trying to fool them heh

#### Docks
I'm not usually there but I am there when I want a big crowd.

### Pony Town quotes Hall-of-Fame (My picks)
If one of the people in these quotes is you then contact me to remove it and start saying this stuff in your private chat or never try to say it at all... but only if we're around of course haha
