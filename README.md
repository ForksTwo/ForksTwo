## Welcome to my GitHub!!
### (if you visited because i quoted something in chat it is recommended that you read the end of the page)

Hey hey!! I'm Erynn/June **(real names, use with caution)** but you can always call me what my name displays!

Unlike other most Pony Town players who use github for their accounts, I actually want to plan a very awesome game but I suck at coding and I'm only good with Scratch and all that so just expect my whole github to just be pt related until this fills up with _serious game development_

Oh yeah im a big lostwave enthusiast. If you love lostwave and play pt then you can always hang out with me and @MrHappyNSad :)

### Where to find me in Pony Town!!!! :D
  You can find me on the following marked plots on the Pony Town safe server map:

</p>
  Here are my socials! (Of course you might find my Google with my real name but that's for personal reasons AND OF COURSE I PHOTOSHOPPED FORKSTOE'S TWITTER INTO THE SCREENSHOT BECAUSE PEOPLE BELIEVE I AM FORKSTOE)

#### Outside the bakery (and inside too)
I mostly sit outside of the bakery and in most cases you can see me in or somewhere surrounding the bush in this area. 

We're there when we're trying to give out a 'be careful what you say' look and be the most hated players

The reason why we're there is because it is highly populated which is a hotspot for us to collect chats from players that do some pretty sus things in the SAFE SERVER (but of course we don't only collect in that area)

(jk the actual reason why i started being there is because i found a few lostwave fans there and then I met @MrHappyNSad and then we started being there everyday then there was weezer then there was our quoting era)

#### OSC area
I dunno where these are assumptions are coming from, I AM ACTUALLY NOT THAT FORKSTOE PERSON from the osc area stop asking :(

But the reason why I marked it on the map and put a section here is because people think I am and I actually like that people think I'm someone else

#### Docks
I'm not usually there but I am there when I want a big crowd or somewhere to join in.

### Pony Town quotes Hall-of-Fame (My picks)
#### MASSIVE WARNING FOR THE OVERTHINKERS
**First of all, depending on our moods we or we don't do this for fun**<br>
**We do this because I'm a little concerned that the devs aren't taking their GOOD players seriously, and pt is full of toxic players. I've been told to _shut up_ and _kill myself_ many times on a PG server when I didn't do anything and I've always felt better when I remember that there's so many people that still care for me**<br>

**If you're just pissed by our quotes and think we're "spamming" then just block and hide us.**

If you want to be whitelisted from being quoted from us then perform the following steps:
1. If you think you've said something wrong then quote yourself and say to yourself what things you've remembered saying in the past
2. You get whitelisted from being quoted good job

Here are a few reasons why we quote (useless but whatever)
* In the OSC area there is someone in the main bush who mostly sits there everyday looking like they're doing nothing. But what they do is they eavesdrop on almost the entire area and copy paste them to quote them (I was a victim of their quoting once which inspired me to become the quoter outside of the bakery)
* Two players that forever gave me online trauma. However I will not explain who they were and I want none of this to be immediately brought up to me unless I do
* There are some cases when someone looks at a random player and then a moment later that random player becomes famous in pt (which kinda happened to me) so just in case someone gets popular I'll remind players what they used to be

If you're contained in this list or know someone in this list that you wanted to be removed then you can always contact me to remove it.

(Don't be scared to contact me, we actually don't laugh and our quoting is purely judgement-free)

_Of course, we mean no harm here and you can always read the texts above_
