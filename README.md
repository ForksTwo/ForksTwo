## Welcome to my GitHub!!

Hey hey!! I'm Erynn/June **(real names, use with caution)** but you can always call me what my name displays!

Unlike other most Pony Town players who use github for their accounts, I actually want to plan a very awesome game but I suck at coding and I'm only good with Scratch and all that so just expect my whole github to just be pt related until this fills up with _serious game development haha_

Oh yeah im a big lostwave enthusiast. If you love lostwave and play pt then you can always hang out with me and @MrHappyNSad :)

### Where to find me in Pony Town!!!! :D
  You can find me on the following marked plots on the Pony Town safe server map:

  Here are my socials! (Of course you might find my Google with my real name but that's for personal reasons AND OF COURSE I PHOTOSHOPPED FORKSTOE'S TWITTER INTO THE SCREENSHOT BECAUSE PEOPLE BELIEVE I AM FORKSTOE)

#### Outside the bakery (and inside too)
I mostly sit outside of the bakery and in most cases you can see me in or somewhere surrounding the bush in this area. 

Sometimes we like to collect messages from other people who is unaware that they're in the safe server. If they say it we repeat it. **But we mean no harm in a bad way tho and you can read more in the quotes hall of fame**

We're there when we're trying to give out a 'be careful what you say' look and be the most hated players

The reason why we're there is because it is highly populated which is a hotspot for us to collect chats from players that do some pretty sus things in the SAFE SERVER (but of course we don't only collect in that area)

(jk the actual reason why i started being there is because i found a few lostwave fans there and then I met @MrHappyNSad and then we started being there everyday then there was weezer then there was our quoting era)

#### OSC area
I dunno where these are assumptions are coming from, I AM ACTUALLY NOT THAT FORKSTOE PERSON from the osc area stop asking :(

But the reason why I marked it on the map and put a section here is because people think I am and I actually like that people think I'm someone else

#### Docks
I'm not usually there but I am there when I want a big crowd or somewhere to join in.

### Pony Town quotes Hall-of-Fame (My picks)
**First of all, we don't do this for fun**<br>
**We do this because I'm a little concerned that the devs aren't taking their GOOD players seriously, and pt is full of toxic players. I've been told to _shut up_ and _kill myself_ many times on a PG server when I didn't do anything and I always felt better when I remember that there's so many people that still care for me**<br>

**If you're just pissed by our quotes and think we're "spamming" then just block and hide us. It's not that hard and if we quoted you, it's your fault that you have to say it out loud in a PG-assumed space that is more demonic than the 18+ one.**

I know I'm sounding like some pt mod wannabe but this is what the game has always been and I know our quoting won't do much

If you're contained in this list or know someone in this list you can always contact me to remove it and start saying these types of stuff in your private chat or never try to say it at all... but only if we're around of course (we're not like mods or your parents whatever haha)

(Don't be scared to contact me, I won't directly bring it up and make fun of whoever it was whenever I see you again)

_Of course, we mean no harm here and you can always read the above_
