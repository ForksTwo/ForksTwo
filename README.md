## Welcome to my GitHub!!

Hey hey!! I'm Erynn/June (real names, use with caution) but you can always call me what my name displays!

#### Where to find me in Pony Town!!!! :D
You can find me on the following marked plots on the Pony Town safe server map:

</p>

I mostly sit outside of the bakery with my friend @MrHappyNSad, and in most cases you can see me in or somewhere surrounding the bush in this area. 
We're there because we're trying to give out a 'be careful what you say' look

If you see me in the OSC area, you might not determine that it wouldn't be me, perhaps a funny creature who is the only existant of its species, Forkstoe
(idk who forkstoe is so you might wanna ask it /srs)

#### Pony Town quotes Hall-of-Fame (My picks)
If one of the people in these quotes is you then contact me to remove it and start saying this stuff in your private chat or never try to say it at all... but only if we're around of course haha
